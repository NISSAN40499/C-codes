### JOINS IN SQL
```
SELECT *
FROM movies
JOIN FINANCIALS
ON MOVIES.MOVIE_ID = FINANCIALS.MOVIE_ID;
```

### MOVIE_ID IS THE SAME IN BOTH TABLE THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO SPECIFY IT USING MOVIES.MOVIE_ID

#### INNER JOIN 
```
SELECT 
	MOVIES.MOVIE_ID, TITLE, CURRENCY, BUDGET, UNIT
FROM MOVIES
JOIN
	FINANCIALS
    ON MOVIES.MOVIE_ID = FINANCIALS.MOVIE_ID;
```
#### Same same but different style
```
SELECT
M.MOVIE_ID, TITLE, CURRENCY, UNIT
FROM MOVIES M 
INNER JOIN FINANCIALS F 
ON M.MOVIE_ID =F.MOVIE_ID;
```

### LEFT JOIN
```
SELECT
M.MOVIE_ID, TITLE, CURRENCY, UNIT
FROM MOVIES M 
LEFT JOIN FINANCIALS F 
ON M.MOVIE_ID =F.MOVIE_ID;
```
### RIGHT JOIN 
```
SELECT
F.MOVIE_ID, TITLE, CURRENCY, UNIT
FROM MOVIES M 
RIGHT JOIN FINANCIALS F 
ON M.MOVIE_ID =F.MOVIE_ID;
```
### FULL JOIN 
```
SELECT
M.MOVIE_ID, TITLE, CURRENCY, UNIT
FROM MOVIES M 
LEFT JOIN FINANCIALS F 
ON M.MOVIE_ID =F.MOVIE_ID

UNION 

SELECT
F.MOVIE_ID, TITLE, CURRENCY, UNIT
FROM MOVIES M 
RIGHT JOIN FINANCIALS F 
ON M.MOVIE_ID =F.MOVIE_ID;
```
### USING --------------- THIS CAN BE USED TO JOIN BASED ON MULTIPLE COLUMNS -----------------------
```
SELECT
MOVIE_ID, TITLE, CURRENCY, UNIT
FROM MOVIES
RIGHT JOIN FINANCIALS
USING(MOVIE_ID);
```
### 1. Show all the movies with their language names
```
SELECT * 
FROM movies
JOIN LANGUAGES
ON MOVIES.LANGUAGE_ID = LANGUAGES.LANGUAGE_ID;
```
### 2. Show all Telugu movie names (assuming you don't know the languageid for Telugu)
```
SELECT MOVIES.TITLE
FROM movies
JOIN LANGUAGES
ON MOVIES.LANGUAGE_ID = LANGUAGES.LANGUAGE_ID
WHERE  LANGUAGES.NAME LIKE "%TELUGU%";
```
### 3.Show the language and number of movies released in that language
```
SELECT 
LANGUAGES.NAME,
COUNT(MOVIES.LANGUAGE_ID)
FROM MOVIES
JOIN LANGUAGES
ON MOVIES.LANGUAGE_ID = LANGUAGES.LANGUAGE_ID
WHERE LANGUAGES.NAME LIKE "%TELUGU%"
GROUP BY LANGUAGES.NAME;
```

### CROSS JOIN - CARTESIAN PRODUCT X * X
```
USE FOOD_DB;

SELECT *,
CONCAT(NAME, " ", VARIANT_NAME) AS FULL_NAME,
(PRICE+VARIANT_PRICE) AS FULL_PRICE
FROM food_db.ITEMS
CROSS JOIN VARIANTS;
    *,
    ROUND((budget_inr / NULLIF(revenue_inr, 0)) * 100, 2) AS profit_pct
FROM conversion_cte;
```

### SUBQUERIES 
```
SELECT * 
	FROM MOVIES 
    WHERE iMDB_RATING = (SELECT MAX(IMDB_RATING) AS MAX_IMDB_RATING FROM MOVIES);
```
### With 2 aggregated columns

```    
SELECT *
	FROM MOVIES 
    WHERE IMDB_RATING IN (
    (SELECT MIN(IMDB_RATING)AS MIN_RATING FROM MOVIES), 
    (SELECT MAX(IMDB_RATING)AS MAX_RATING FROM MOVIES)
    );

```

### THIS TWO CODE WILL DOES THE SAME, FIRST ONE IS USED SUBQUERY AND SECOND ONE IS USING HAVING CLAUSE.
```
 SELECT * FROM
(SELECT
    NAME,
    YEAR(CURDATE()) - BIRTH_YEAR AS AGE
FROM ACTORS) AS ACTORS_AGE
WHERE AGE > 70 AND AGE < 85
ORDER BY AGE DESC;
    

SELECT
	NAME,
    YEAR(CURDATE())-BIRTH_YEAR AS AGE
FROM ACTORS
HAVING AGE > 70 AND AGE < 85
ORDER BY AGE DESC;
```

### ANY 
```
SELECT * 
FROM ACTORS 
WHERE ACTOR_ID = ANY
(SELECT
	ACTOR_ID 
FROM MOVIE_ACTOR 
	WHERE MOVIE_ID IN (101,110,121));

```

### IN (any, in will do the same here)
```
 SELECT *
 FROM ACTORS
 WHERE ACTOR_ID IN
(SELECT
	ACTOR_ID
FROM MOVIE_ACTOR
 WHERE MOVIE_ID IN (101,110,121));   
```
### SHOWS IMDB RATING FOR MOVIES GREATER THAN MARVEL STUDIO MOVIES RATING 
```
SELECT * FROM
MOVIES WHERE IMDB_RATING > ANY
(SELECT IMDB_RATING
FROM MOVIES 
WHERE STUDIO = "MARVEL STUDIOS");
```
### SOME
```
SELECT * FROM
MOVIES WHERE IMDB_RATING > SOME
(SELECT IMDB_RATING
FROM MOVIES 
WHERE STUDIO = "MARVEL STUDIOS");
``` 
### CO-RELATED SUBQUERY 
```
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT
	ACTOR_ID,
    NAME,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM MOVIE_ACTOR
    WHERE ACTOR_ID = ACTORS.ACTOR_ID) AS MOVIES_COUNT -- HERE SUBQUERY IS REFERING AN OUTER TABLE NAMED ACTORS AND THUS IT IS CALLED CO-RELATED SUBQUERY
FROM ACTORS
ORDER BY MOVIES_COUNT DESC;
```

### WE CAN ACHIEVE THE SAME USING JOINS
```
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT
	ACTORS.ACTOR_ID,
    ACTORS.NAME,
    COUNT(*) AS MOVIES_COUNT
FROM MOVIE_ACTOR
JOIN ACTORS ON
MOVIE_ACTOR.ACTOR_ID = ACTORS.ACTOR_ID
GROUP BY ACTOR_ID
ORDER BY MOVIES_COUNT DESC; 
``` 
### HERE WE CAN SEE CO-RELATED QUERY IS PERFORMING BETTER!
